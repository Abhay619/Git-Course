Set the origin repository - git remote (set-url or add) origin git@github.com:Abhay619/Git-Course.git
Check origin Status - git remote -v
Initial Coe push to Github - git push -u origin main
Everytime we want the commit to reflect on the remote server (Github) we have to use add command, then Commit command and then git push. (git add . -> git commit -m "Message" -> git push)

SSH Key Generation Command - ssh-keygen
Add the SSH Public Key to Github Command - cat <Public_Key>

Branching: 
Command to create a new branch - git branch "Branch_Name" or git checkout -b "Branch_Name"
Command to show all branches - git branch
Command to switch branches - git checkout "Branch_Name"
Command to merge the branch to main - git merge origin/Branch_Name

Trying to fork on github

git pull command also helps in updating local machine with all the commits done on the server, like if we create a pull request and merge a branch on Github, it will not merge in local git, so to merge it we will use git pull command to pull all the updates.
